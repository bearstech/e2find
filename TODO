e2sync: Optimize for speed :
- prefer IO::Poll for lower bit/vector maintenance overhead (than ::Select)
- use nonblocking reads + own unbuffered line splitting to read as much lines as possible per poll() call
  (1 poll/select per line is too expensive)

e2sync: handle rsync errors as warnings :
- as a default, filter "normal error" rsync error 6144 (24     Partial transfer due to vanished source files)
- add an option to allow to fail on any error

- finish README.md
- add man page
- write e2du fast drill-down tool (or find a way to plug e2find in ncdu)

- e2find.c: tune buffer_blocks
- e2find.c: make use of 4-byte aligned dirents to extends dirents address space to 2^34 ?
